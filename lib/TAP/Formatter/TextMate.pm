=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< new >>

Create a new C<< TAP::Formatter::TextMate >>.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = $class->SUPER::new( @_ );
    return $self;
}

=head2 C<prepare>

Called by Test::Harness before any test output is generated. 

=cut

sub prepare {
    my ( $self, @tests ) = @_;

    my $html = $self->_html;

    print $html->open( 'html' ),
      $html->head( [ \'style', $self->_stylesheet ] ), $html->open( 'body' ),
      "\n";

    $self->SUPER::prepare( @tests );
}

=head3 C<open_test>

Called to create a new test session.

=cut

sub open_test {
    my ( $self, $test, $parser ) = @_;

    my $session = TAP::Formatter::TextMate::Session->new(
        {
            name      => $test,
            formatter => $self,
            parser    => $parser
        }
    );

    $session->header;

    return $session;
}

=head3 C<summary>

  $harness->summary( $aggregate );

C<summary> prints the summary report after all tests are run.  The argument is
an aggregate.

=cut

    my ( $self, $aggregate ) = @_;
    my $html = $self->_html;
    $self->SUPER::summary( $aggregate );
    print $html->close( 'body' ), $html->close( 'html' ), "\n";
